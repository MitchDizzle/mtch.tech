## Recipe Info

- **Prep Time:** 20 minutes
- **Bake Time:** 50 minutes
- **Makes:** 2 Loaves or ~90 mini muffins

## Ingredients

### Base
- 1 stick (8 tbsp) Unsalted Butter
- ½ cup Granulated Sugar

### Wet Ingredients
- 2 Large Eggs
- 1 (15oz) Can of Pumpkin Puree
- ½ cup Maple Syrup
- 1 tsp Pure Vanilla
- 1 tsp Maple Extract (or more Vanilla)
- Optional: ½ cup Yogurt (Greek)

### Dry Ingredients
- 2 cups (240 grams) All-Purpose Flour
- 2 tbsp Ground Cinnamon
- 2 tsp Baking Powder
- 1 tsp Baking Soda
- 2 tsp Salt

## Preparation

1. **Optional:** Brown the butter. Caution as this can go from a nice simmer to burnt. Let butter cool before using.

2. Combine Butter and Sugar in a large mixing bowl. Then mix in Wet Ingredients (Eggs, Pumpkin Puree, Maple Syrup, Vanilla, Maple Extract).

3. In a separate large bowl combine the Dry Ingredients (Flour, Cinnamon, Baking Powder, Baking Soda, Salt).

4. Add in the Dry mixture to the Wet half at a time and mix to prevent overworking.

5. **Optional:** Mix in ½ cup of morsels to the bowl. Hershey's Cinnamon Chips work great with this recipe.

6. Grease and fill 2x 9"x5" Bread Loaf Pans.

7. **Optional:** Add chocolate chips to top.

8. Bake at 350°F for 40-60 minutes. Time differs on ovens. Cook until a Toothpick comes out clean of any batter.

## Tips

**Mini Muffins** - Cook time is drastically lower at 350°F, about 10-14 minutes. Time changes depending on the amount of pans in the oven also.

**Overmixing** - Best to combine ingredients by hand to prevent overworking the dry ingredients in.

**Yogurt** - This adds more moisture to the bread, will be fine without it, however the bread will need to be refrigerated to keep fresh.

**Puree Replacement** - Pumpkin Puree can be replaced with Mashed Banana to make banana bread! 2 ½ cups mashed banana works well.
